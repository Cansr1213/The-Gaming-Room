# The-Gaming-Room
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
The Gaming Room is client that have moblie game called "Draw It or Lose It". The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software fuctionality and expand their game to various platforms. Client wanted application to delivered as a modern, responsive HTML interface running inside the web browser for desktop clients (Linux, Mac, Windows), as well as on mobile platform.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   I feel like I did well listing all the OS fuctionality and their Pro-Cons of using a specfic OS. This gives the client a better understanding of which OS would best work for their application they are trying to expand.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   It gives a clear design document guides developers by detailing project requirements, architecture, and technical specs. It ensures consistent code through UI, error handling, and integration insights while facilitating testing and scalability strategies, fostering a shared vision and accountability.
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     I would revise explaing and identify development tools in my project two. I would improve my work by discussing around various programming languages, IDE's, ect. This would give the client a better of understanding of of the langues that can be use to expand their game application.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I understood user needs through requirements analysis and designed software that prioritized usability and functionality. Considering user needs is vital as it ensures real-world alignment, enhances user satisfaction, and bridges the gap between technical capabilities and user expectations for a more effective and intuitive experience.
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
